# SIC_CapstoneProject
IoT Sensor Data Logger on Raspberry Pi in which you are an IoT engineer at a smart home startup and the boss has asked to set up a Raspberry Pi to log simulated sensor data (e.g., temperature readings).

 You will:
 
  Collect and store simulated data.
 
  Organize files and directories.
 
  Secure access with users and permissions.
 
  Monitor processes and logs.
 
  Automate tasks with shell scripting.
 
  Apply production-like reliability (log rotation, scheduling, archiving)
